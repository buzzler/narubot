## NaruBot

NaruBot is a real-time conversational AI system that integrates Speech-to-Text (STT), Text-to-Speech (TTS), and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable natural, low-latency voice interaction.

The project focuses on designing an event-driven pipeline that handles audio input, language understanding, and speech synthesis in real time. While the current implementation runs fully in software, the system is intentionally designed with constrained, hardware-like interfaces in mind.

The long-term goal is to extend Narubot to a custom hardware agent cartridge inspired by retro console environments, exploring how modern AI systems can operate under limited I/O, timing, and interaction constraints.
